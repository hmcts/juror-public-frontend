### What is it?
The Juror Digital solution for prospective Jurors provides an online service to allow people to respond via a website instead of using the paper form. Jurors provide their Juror Number (as provided on the invitation letter), surname and postcode. They are taken through the steps to confirm their details, and on to providing their response (acceptance, deferral or excusal), and to provide any supporting documentation. Upon completion, they are provided with confirmation by email that their response has been submitted for processing.
